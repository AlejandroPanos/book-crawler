We would normally want to create a virtual environment to run our Python code.
This allows us to run Python code and install dependencies for a specific project.
This means that, if we update packages but we running other versions of the package
in other projects, we won't run into errors due to version incompatibility.

To create a virtual environment:
    1. Make sure to be in your working root folder
    2. Run the command python3 -m venv venv to create the vinv folder
    3. Run the command source venv/bin/activate to activate the virtual environment

Here are the scripts we need to run in order to create a scrapy project:

    1. scrapy startproject name_of_project → This is the first one we run to start a project with its boilerplate code
    2. scrapy genspider name_of_spider website_to_scrape → We MUST run this command in the spiders folder 
    to create a spider.
